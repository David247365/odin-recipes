    <h3>This recipe is made from fresh pumpkin, not canned. Hope you enjoy it as much as my family does. Happy Thanksgiving.</h3>
    <p>Pumpkin cookies, pumpkin bars, pumpkin lattes, pumpkin cupcakes, pumpkin bread, but HELLO what about pumpkin pie?? My Great Pumpkin Pie Recipe is here today.</p>
    <p>Did you know that testing the <b>perfect pumpkin pie recipe</b> is a lot more challenging than one would assume!? Fresh pumpkin, canned pumpkin, ginger, no ginger, brown sugar, white sugar, cornstarch, flour, no cornstarch, no flour…?</p>
    <p>But I finally I cracked the pumpkin pie code. I grew up in a house of pumpkin pie lovers and absolutely no Thanksgiving was complete without a nap and a massive slice of pumpkin pie. What I’m trying to say is, my pumpkin pie standards are high for this classic Thanksgiving dessert.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p><b>Pastry for Single-Crust Pie:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup shortening</li>
        <li>3 ½ tablespoons cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Filling:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pumpkin</li>
        <li>1 &lpar;12 fluid ounce&rpar; can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F &lpar;200 degrees C&rpar;.</li>
        <li>Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour and salt. Cut shortening into flour; add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time &lpar;you may need only 3 tablespoons, or up to 4 tablespoons&rpar;. Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold together. </li>
        <li>With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly floured board roll dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness. With a sharp knife, cut dough 1 1/2 inch larger than the upside-down 8- to 9-inch pie pan. Gently roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it right-side up onto the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pie pan.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt with an electric mixer or immersion blender. Mix well. Pour into a prepared crust. Bake 40 minutes or until when a knife is inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean.</li>
    </ol>
